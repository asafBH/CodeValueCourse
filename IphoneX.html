            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>iPhone X (Roman numeral "X" pronounced "ten") is a smartphone designed, developed, and marketed by Apple
                Inc.
                It was the eleventh generation of the iPhone. It was announced on September 12, 2017, alongside the
                iPhone 8
                and iPhone 8 Plus, at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus.
                The phone was released on November 3, 2017, marking the iPhone series' tenth anniversary.
                The iPhone X is intended to showcase what Apple considers technology of the future, specifically
                adopting
                OLED screen technology for the first time in iPhone history, as well as using a glass and
                stainless-steel
                form factor, offering wireless charging,
                and removing the home button in favor of introducing a new "bezel-less" design, shrinking the bezels,
                and
                not having a "chin", unlike
                many Android phones. It also released a new type of password authentication called Face ID. Face ID is a
                new
                authentication
                method using advanced technologies to scan the user's face to unlock the device, as well as for the use
                of
                animated emojis called Animoji.
                The new, nearly bezel-less form factor marks a significant change to the iPhone user interaction,
                involving
                swipe-based gestures to navigate around the operating system rather than the typical home button used in
                every previous iteration of the iPhone lineup. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of
                US$999 also made it the most expensive iPhone
                ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.</p>
